# REST-API-24
REST-API code for task 2, 3 and 4 of the 2024 Field Robot Event.

REST Communication and Interface

Tasks 2, 3 and 4 require data exchange with a central benchmark and validation server (BVS). The
BVS will provide a REST API and its definition will be published as an OpenAPI (https://www.openapis.org/) definition in
May. A test BVS will be up and running by midth of May. For the communication, the organising
team will provide an access point which has to be fixed on the field robot, e.g. by Velcro band.
The field robot has to send its data via ethernet cable to the access point, no additional WLAN is
required by the teams.
